### Workshop description
This repository provided teaching material for a 2 hour workshop on the application of R in bioinformatics. The participants do not require pre-requisites on computational skills. The workshop is divided in two part. The first will consist of an introduction to R and R studio, and [basic data visualization and descritpive statistics](https://github.com/RicardoMartins-Ferreira/WorkshopR_Bioinformatics_FCUP2024/blob/main/Part%201_data%20visualization%20and%20descriptive%20statistics.html). The second part of the workshop approches the use of R in the [analysis of RNA-seq data](https://github.com/RicardoMartins-Ferreira/WorkshopR_Bioinformatics_FCUP2024/blob/main/Part%202%20-%20RNA-seq%20analysis%20with%20DESeq2.html). 

### Pre-requisites
